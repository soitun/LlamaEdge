# LlamaEdge Rust SDK - Cargo Configuration
#
# This SDK is a native Rust library supporting macOS, Linux, and Windows.
# It is intentionally excluded from the workspace to avoid inheriting
# WASM-specific patches and configurations.
#
# IMPORTANT: When building within this monorepo, you must specify the target explicitly:
#   cargo build --target aarch64-apple-darwin  # macOS ARM64
#   cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin   # macOS Intel
#   cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu  # Linux
#   cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc    # Windows
#
# When this crate is used as a dependency in another project (outside this monorepo),
# it will build normally without needing to specify a target.

[build]
# Remove wasm-specific rustflags from parent config
rustflags = []
